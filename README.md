# 🎨 Colour Sequence Detector

Design of A Colour Sequence Detector for a 5-core Harness Cable

Low-cost tester for verifying the **colour sequence** and **continuity** of 5-core harness cables at both ends of a wire roll.  

---

## 📜 Overview

This device checks if both ends of a cable have the **same wire colour sequence** and ensures **continuity**.  
It was developed as a more efficient alternative to the manual continuity tester for the Harness Department at Cable Solutions (Pvt) Ltd.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. A **555 Timer** generates clock pulses.  
2. Two **CD4017 Decade Counters** are clocked together:  
   - One drives the positive side of LEDs.  
   - The other (through a **NOT gate**) drives the negative side.  
3. When the wire order matches at both ends, the corresponding LED lights up.

## 💡 Features

- Tests **5 cores** (expandable to 10 for a single CD4017).  
- Detects **sequence** and **continuity**.  
- **No microcontroller** → reduced cost.
- Powered via 9V battery.
- Tested via **Proteus 8 Professional** simulation and breadboard prototype.
